# Reciepe for making Rava Dosa

1. Take ½ cup unroasted fine rava, ½ cup rice flour and ¼ cup all-purpose flour in a bowl.
2. Then add ⅓ cup chopped onions, 1 or 2 green chillies (chopped), and ½ inch ginger (chopped).
3. Also add ½ tsp crushed black pepper, ½ tsp cumin seeds, 8 to 10 curry leaves (chopped) and salt as required. You can also add 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped cashews.
4. Add 2 to 2.5 cups water. Depending on the quality of rava or suji and rice flour, you can add less or more water – from 1.5 to 2.5 cups water. I added 2.25 cups of water. You can also use buttermilk instead of water.
5. Whisk till smooth without any lumps. The batter has to be flowing and thin. If the batter looks thick or has a medium consistency, then add more water. If the batter looks very thin and runny, then add some rice flour.
6. Cover and let the batter rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the batter rests, you will see that the rava and the flours have settled down and the water will be floating on top.
7. Before preparing dosa, mix the batter very well.
8. Spread some oil on the tawa. Do make sure that the tawa is hot. Keep the flame to medium or medium-high before pouring the dosa batter.
9. With a ladle pour the dosa batter. Start from the edges move towards the center
10. If there are big or small gaps, then fill them lightly with the batter.
11. On a medium-low to medium flame, cook the dosa. If the tawa or pan becomes too hot, then you can reduce the flame.
12. When the top side looks cooked, then sprinkle ½ to 1 tsp oil on the top and sides.
13. Spread oil all over the dosa with a spoon.
14. Instant rava dosa takes a little longer time to cook than the regular Dosa.
15. Cook till the base is golden and crisp.
16. The more you cook the dosas and the more golden it becomes, the more crisp it will be. You can even cook both the sides if you want.
17. Fold and then serve instant rava dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar. The flours settle down at the bottom of the batter. So you have to stir and mix the batter very well every time you make dosa.
In case the batter becomes thick after making a few dosa, then add some water and stir again. Make all dosa this way.
18. Serve rava dosa with sambar, coconut chutney or dosa podi or any chutney of your choice.
